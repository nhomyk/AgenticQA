## Autonomous Agent (Agentic Engineering Expert)

The project includes a powerful **LangGraph-based Agentic Engineering Expert** that autonomously scans production URLs, analyzes them using the actual product, and generates AI-powered improvement recommendations. This is your personal engineering expert that continuously evaluates external websites for quality, accessibility, and testing opportunities.

### What Makes It an Agentic Engineering Expert

The agent combines three specialized tools to provide expert-level QA analysis:

1. **Codebase Intelligence** - Understands your project structure and organization
2. **Real-World Testing** - Uses the actual product UI to scan external websites (like a real engineer would)
3. **Expert Recommendations** - Generates intelligent, context-aware improvement suggestions based on actual findings

### Agent Capabilities

The agent autonomously:

✅ **Scans Production URLs in Real-Time**
- Analyzes any website: `https://yahoo.com`, `https://cbs.com`, `https://github.com`, etc.
- Uses Playwright to navigate and interact with sites just like a human QA engineer
- Extracts accessibility issues, performance metrics, API usage patterns
- Captures console errors, network failures, DOM problems

✅ **Uses Your Actual Product to Test**

- Fills URL input field with target website
- Clicks scan button to initiate real QA analysis
- Waits for results (up to 30 seconds)
- Extracts all result sections:
  - Scan results (console errors, DOM issues)
  - Generated test cases
  - Performance metrics
  - Detected APIs
  - Code generation examples (Playwright, Cypress)
  - **AI-generated recommendations**

#### Tool 3: analyzeResults() & generateRecommendations()
- Analyzes scan findings with intelligent pattern matching
- Counts issues by type (accessibility, performance, security)
- Generates expert recommendations based on:
  - Number and severity of accessibility issues
  - Performance metrics (load time, failed requests)
  - Detected APIs and testing opportunities

## Autonomous Agent

This project includes a **LangGraph-based autonomous agent** that combines codebase analysis with UI interaction to provide comprehensive QA insights.

### Agent Overview

The agent (`agent.js`) uses LangChain and LangGraph to orchestrate three specialized tools:

1. **scanCodebase()** - Analyzes project structure recursively (2 levels deep)
   - Scans all `.js`, `.json`, `.css`, `.html` files
   - Ignores: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `coverage/`, `test-results/`, `.next/`, `dist/`, `build/`
   - Returns: File count, directory structure, technology stack

2. **submitURLToFrontend()** - Uses Playwright for browser automation
   - Navigates to application URL
   - Fills in scan input field with detected codebase info
   - Clicks "Scan" button
   - Waits for results to load
   - Extracts findings from result sections

3. **analyzeResults()** - Processes scan findings
   - Counts identified issues
   - Extracts test cases and performance metrics
   - Detects APIs and code generation capabilities
   - Generates summary statistics

### Running the Agent

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
npm run agent "https://example.com"
```

**With Running Server:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the application
npm start

# Terminal 2: Run the agent
npm run agent "http://localhost:3000"
```

**Programmatic Usage:**
```javascript
const { QAAgent } = require('./agent.js');

const agent = new QAAgent();
await agent.run('http://localhost:3000');

// Access results:
// agent.scanResults - Raw API response
// agent.analysis - Processed statistics
```

### Agent Workflow

The agent follows this 3-step workflow:

```

- **Conditional Execution** - Tests run independently even if linting fails (with `if: always()`)

**Test Results:**
- Each test suite can be run independently
- Failed tests trigger the SRE Engineer workflow automatically
- All test jobs depend on lint but continue even if lint warnings occur

#### 2. **Agentic SRE Engineer Workflow** (`agentic-sre-engineer.yml`)
Automatically diagnoses and fixes failing CI jobs:

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Detects failing workflow runs and analyzes root causes
- ✅ Removes unused ESLint directives from generated files
- ✅ Adds missing globals (URL, etc.) to ESLint configuration
- ✅ Fixes unused variables and quote consistency issues
- ✅ Handles port conflicts (EADDRINUSE errors)
- ✅ Configures proper server shutdown and cleanup
- ✅ Retries tests multiple times to handle intermittent failures
- ✅ Auto-commits fixes and pushes to main branch
- ✅ Triggers CI workflow after making fixes to validate results
- ✅ Sends email notifications on completion

**Key Features:**
- Graceful error handling with non-critical operations
- Timeout prevention (hard stop at 25 minutes)
- Multiple iteration support (up to 3 attempts)
- Intelligent issue detection from workflow logs
- Git authentication using GITHUB_TOKEN with proper URL rewriting

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors failed workflow runs (lint, tests)
2. Analyzes logs to identify specific issues
3. Makes intelligent code changes:
   - Applies ESLint --fix
   - Updates configuration files
   - Improves error handling
   - Fixes server/port issues
4. Commits changes and retriggers CI
5. Sends summary via email

### Running Tests Locally

## Notes & Limitations

- Results are limited to 25 items per scan
- Puppeteer downloads a Chromium binary on first install (requires network access)
- Some advanced accessibility or performance issues may not be detected
- For troubleshooting Puppeteer launch issues, ensure Chrome/Chromium is available and accessible
- SRE Agent requires GITHUB_TOKEN with `contents: write` permission
- SMTP configuration needed for email notifications (SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT)
