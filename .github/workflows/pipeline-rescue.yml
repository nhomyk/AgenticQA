## Status
- Pipeline Status: FAILED
- Auto-Repair: FAILED
- Manual Action: REQUIRED

## What Happened
The main CI/CD pipeline is in a failed state and the automated repair system could not fix it.

## Required Actions
1. Review the latest workflow run: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
2. Check the Rescue System logs for error details
3. Manually fix the issue or reset to last known good state

## Recommended Fixes
- Check .github/workflows/ci.yml for syntax errors
- Run: \`npm install -g js-yaml && js-yaml .github/workflows/ci.yml\`
- Review recent commits to workflow files
- Reset to previous commit if needed: \`git revert HEAD\`

See repair-workflow.js for diagnostic info.
