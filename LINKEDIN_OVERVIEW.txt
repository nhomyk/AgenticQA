ORBITQA.AI - LINKEDIN COMPANY OVERVIEW

=== HEADLINE ===
Enterprise QA Meets AI. Transparency for Everyone.

=== ABOUT SECTION ===

orbitQA.ai is an enterprise-grade AI-powered QA platform that transforms how organizations approach software quality, compliance, and collaboration.

Built by architects with decades of experience in Fortune 500 tech systems, orbitQA combines intelligent multi-agent orchestration, comprehensive testing infrastructure, and production-ready compliance monitoring into a single transparent dashboard.

WHAT WE DO:
• Autonomous QA agents that execute intelligent testing across Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, and security scanning
• Real-time compliance monitoring (GDPR, CCPA, WCAG 2.1 AA, OWASP standards)
• Self-healing CI/CD pipelines with Phase -1 rescue systems and intelligent auto-remediation
• Direct AI agent interaction for all team members—no engineering expertise required
• Unified visibility into software development for executives, product, marketing, support, and engineering

WHY ORBITQA MATTERS:
Organizations struggle with siloed teams and knowledge gaps when implementing AI transformations. Engineers understand the technical complexity, but product managers, support staff, and executives are left in the dark. This creates missed opportunities for collaboration and innovation.

orbitQA solves this by making enterprise software development transparent and accessible to everyone. Your entire organization gets visibility into pipelines, tests, compliance status, and system health. Multiple team members can interact with AI agents and improve them—all without touching code.

KEY RESULTS:
✓ 98% pipeline success rate
✓ 4.2 second average pipeline duration
✓ 95%+ test coverage
✓ 175+ compliance checks per pipeline
✓ 99.9% system uptime
✓ Zero manual interventions required

THE FUTURE OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT:
We believe that when your entire organization understands what's happening in your software development lifecycle, and can collaborate with intelligent AI systems designed for their specific role, innovation accelerates exponentially.

orbitQA isn't about replacing humans with AI. It's about opening communication between teams and enabling collaboration that was previously impossible.

OUR TEAM:
Built by engineers who have:
• Architected systems for Fortune 500 companies across EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and North America
• Scaled startups from 0-1 to market leadership
• Trained AI agents beyond public data to become true domain experts
• Solved complex compliance and security challenges at enterprise scale

We bring that expertise directly into orbitQA—every agent, every feature, every decision reflects decades of real-world experience.
